At each step of the tree the variables are split up based on which combination minimizes the distance of the remaining clusters. The more monotone the set of variables, the closer their total distance is to zero, and the closer their average distance (the y-axis) is to zero.\n",

    "To interpret this graph, read it from a top-down perspective. Cluster leaves which linked together at a distance of zero fully predict one another's presence—one variable might always be empty when another is filled, or they might always both be filled or both empty, and so on. In this specific example the dendrogram glues together the variables which are required and therefore present in every record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster leaves which split close to zero, but not at it, predict one another very well, but still imperfectly. If your own interpretation of the dataset is that these columns actually are or ought to be match each other in nullity (for example, as CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 2 and VEHICLE TYPE CODE 2 ought to), then the height of the cluster leaf tells you, in absolute terms, how often the records are \"mismatched\" or incorrectly filed—that is, how many values you would have to fill in or drop, if you are so inclined.\n",
